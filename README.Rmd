Estimating coefficients for measuring psychological distress resulting from various life events  

<br>

## Extension and validation of stressful life events schedule

Instruments for measuring the severity of psychological distress resulting from recent life experiences were originally developed in the 1960s, and are used by clinicians today to identify and predict sources of patient stress. The instrument consists of a checklist containing a list of major life events (e.g., divorce, bankruptcy, death of a loved one), and a weighting is assigned to each item that was determined by asking research volunteers to anticipate the severity of stress that was expected from its occurrence. However people are notoriously poor at anticipating their emotional reaction to abstract events, and large population-based surveys can now provide data which tracks self-reported distress levels after survey respondants have experienced the life event. This provides an opportunity to calculate weights based on experienced distress levels rather than anticipated distress, and so can provide a way to base clinical predictions on empirical evidence. Our other work [@kettlewell2020differential] has determined the causal effect of major life events on clinically-relevant distress measures in large population-based survey data, and results from this project will update current clinical instruments to improve care in Australia and elsewhere.  

#### Background  

Stressful life events have been identified as a risk factor for a variety of physical and mental illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and depression [@bahri2019relation; @kessler1997effects; @slopen2011sex]. Today, clinicians and epidemiologists often assesses the impact of life-events through summed checklists that treat events as equal  [@dohrenwend2006inventorying; @gray2004psychometric; @wethington1995interview]. For example, the Life Events Checklist (LEC) [@gray2004psychometric] is a checklist of events which are associated with the aetiology of PTSD; responders must indicate the degree of exposure (e.g., directly experienced vs witnessed vs heard about), but the LEC does not distinguish the amount of distress from the event itself. A key feature of such checklists is that all life events are treated as equivalent, along with the implicit assumption that different life events have equivalent impacts on distress.  

The original instrument to measure life events was Holmes and Raheâ€™s Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) [@holmes1967social], and this included weights to distinguish and quantify the amount of stress associated with each event. The publication of the SRRS led to an enormous amount of research on the relationship between life events and various types of illness onset (typically screening scales of nonspecific psychological distress), with over 1000 papers using the SRRS published in the first decade after its development [@holmes1979development; @kessler1997effects]. It's reputed advance was in adapting the psychophysical procedure of magnitude estimation to quantify the stressfulness of an event [@dohrenwend1974stressful], which was entirely based on the amount of stress anticipated by research volunteers when imagining the event. Subsequent methodological critiques pointed out the limitations of this method [@dohrenwend1974stressful; @zimmerman1983methodological]; and within the set of fairly serious events included in SRRS life event checklists, the use of differential weights does not markedly increase the association between life event scales and measures of distress [@tibubos2021frequency; @zimmerman1983methodological]. Thus it is not clear whether and how operationalization of a differential weight improves the predictive value of life events checklists over and above frequency or the sum of exposure, and this widely appreciated limitation has led to the proliferation of summed checklists [@turner1997checklist].  

However our earlier research on the impact of major life events in affective wellbeing in a large population-based survey of Australian households between 2001 and 2016 clearly showed that different life events have empirically different impacts on affective wellbeing and mental health [@kettlewell2020differential]. Events such as divorce, major financial loss (e.g., bankruptcy) and death of a loved one (spouse or child) had much larger effects on self-reported affective wellbeing 3 to 12 months later than events such as losing employment (e.g., fired), moving home, or even home destroyed in natural disaster. Furthermore, some events had a beneficial impact on affective wellbeing, such as marriage or pregnancy. In general, our results based on reported experience are consistent with methodological studies of the SRRS (and the various checklists based on it)  demonstrating that negative events are much more powerful predictors of mental health outcomes than positive events [@zautra1983life; @thoits1983dimensions]. It is therefore of interest to provide weighted indexes of life events, based on experience rather than (poorly) anticipated consequences, which large population-based datasets such as HILDA can provide.  

<br><br>

#### Aims  

We aimed to provide clinicians and researchers with a better tool to measure the impact of life events on mental health and the risk of mental illness. First we provide the frequency of life events adjusted for the Australian population to allow comparison with historical and international estimates. Second we estimate the impact of each type of life event on affective wellbeing from survey responses of people who actually experienced the event. The impact is converted to a weight for a life event checklist, from which a weighted or unweighted (summed) score can be determined for each person. Finally we test the predictive value of weighted and unweighted scores for future mental illness, since highly stressful events are assumed to be a cause or risk factor for mental illness such as depression and anxiety.  

##### To do list   

- Estimate weights controlling for age (decade), gender, other events
- What is the correlation between an (unweighted) summed life event score and weighted sum? (i.e., how different are the weights from the frequencies?)
- What are the correlations between the score and MHi-5, K10 (`pdk10rc`, `pdk10s`), `losat`, `losatyh`?  
- Add the marginal effect of increasing `weighted_score` (vs `unweighted_score`) on the outcome (mental illness, MHi-5, etc) to help describe the predictive value of the model and understand how the outcome can change with the coefficient/score

## Methods  

We select all major life events in the HILDA 2020 dataset, which encompasses the two decade period from 2001 to 2020. HILDA includes comprehensive measures of subjective wellbeing, such as the SF-36 from which the MHi-5 score, a measure of mental health, can be calculated.  

The MHi-5 comprises of five items dealing with ... etc.  

We estimate the impact of each life event in a fixed effect regression model of events on mental health (MHi-5 score). Temporal proximity to the event were entered as dummy variables (pre 36 months, pre 24 months, pre 12 months, post 3 months, post 6 months, post 9 months, post 12 months, post 24 months, post 36 months), along with varying effects of survey wave and person. This is the simplest model, equivalent to the "unconditional" model tested in @kettlewell2020differential, without controls for other events.    



```{r import-preprocess}

# before and after the event (i.e., balanced observations)

We present the population-weighted estimates of major life event frequencies (adjusted for age, sex, region-of-State, labour force status, marital status, and household composition) in Australia. For a description of the weight-adjustment, see [Table 4.28 in the HILDA manual](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda/for-data-users/user-manuals).

The most frequent major life event is a illness or injury in a close family member (Family illness) or moving home (Moved) for approximately 15 percent of Australians in any one-year period, while the least frequent is being detained in jail (Jailed) for less than 1 percent. The frequency of some events appear to have declined in the last two decades, including family illness (or injury), moving home (Moved), and starting a new job (Hired). There are no apparent increasing trends in the frequency of any event. It is unclear whether these temporal trends reflect real change in the Australian population or changes in the survey sample as the respondents age over time.

The beta coefficients from these models were used to assign weightings to each event at different time points: 12 mo prior to the event, 3 mo post event, and 12 mo post event.

The impact of events on mental health (MHi-5 scores) varies by event and by time. Consequently, the weighting of each event varies. For example, death of spouse (`Widowed`) and divorce or separation (`Divorced`) are the two worst events at 3 mo afterwards, however by 12 mo afterwards `Bankruptcy` is the worst event, with `Widowed` equal second (along with serious injury `Injured`) and `Divorced` is equal eighth and not significantly different from zero (*p* > .05).  

Some events have a positive effect on mental health (MHi-5 scores) and so are given a negative weighting in this scheme. Marriage, childbirth and pregnancy all have negative weights up to 12 months before the event and three months afterwards. At 12 months after these events, the weight is not significantly different from zero (*p* > .05), highlighting the temporary emotional impact of these positive life events (nb. changes to life satisfaction scores have longer impacts after these events, but not considered here).  

<br><br>

#### Predictive value of weights  

Our second aim was to determine the predictive value of using weighted relative to unweighted scores. We estimated the predictive value of the weighted scores for risk of a MHi-5 score < 64 in the following year [@cuijpers2009screening]. This cut-off was chosen because @batterham2018assessing has shown this is the optimal threshold for identifying individuals with any DSM-V internalising disorder in a community sample.  

Importantly, only years prior to the first MHi-5 event < 64 (illness) were included, in order to prevent any influence of the first illness on life events (or the likelihood of reporting life events), or the contemporaneous influence of a third variable on both. For this reason, the estimates we report are not "contemporaneous associations" between life events and illness, but instead the (1-year) lagged effect.  


```{r create_modelframe}
# The weights were selected from the largest coefficient (post 3 month event), 
# and we only used positive weights  
shi_weights <- read_rds("results/shit_happens_weights.rds") %>%
  select(event, code, weight = post03) %>% # select post03 or post12
  mutate(weight = if_else(weight < 0, 0, weight))

xvars <- events %>%
  gather("key", "val", lebth:levio) %>%
  left_join(select(shi_weights, key = code, weight), by = "key") %>% 
  mutate(shi_weight = val * weight) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shi_weight)) %>%
  arrange(xwaveid, wave) %>%
  group_by(xwaveid, wave) %>%
  summarise(weighted = sum(shi_weight),
            unweighted = sum(val),
            .groups = "drop") 

illness <- demographics %>%
  select(xwaveid, wave, ghmh) %>% 
  mutate(ill = ghmh < 64) %>%
  group_by(xwaveid) %>%
  mutate(
    ill_sum = order_by(wave, cumsum(ill)), # count illness events
    ill_next_year = lead(ill, order_by = wave) # flag years which precede illness
  ) %>% 
  filter(ill_sum == 0) %>% # select years prior to first illness
  select(xwaveid, wave, ill_next_year) %>%
  ungroup()

modelframe <- left_join(illness, xvars, by = c("xwaveid", "wave")) %>%
  select(xwaveid, wave, ill_next_year, weighted, unweighted) %>%
  filter(wave != "a")
```

Our modelling strategy was to first estimate the total effect associated with the weighted and unweighted scores, and then partition the total effect into between-person and within-person effects. The total effect and the between-person effect are important estimates of the predictive value of life events for future mental mental illness across the population, however they are also affected/biased by differences between people, such as gender, age, wealth or stable personality traits (time-invariant features). We are mostly interested in the within-person effect since that tells us whether recent life events can play a role in future illness events for an individual, after removing any other (stable) differences between people. The within-person estimate is thus more clincally relevant (nb. the within-person estimates may still be subject to other (unmeasured) time-varying confounds).  

As the weights are a time-varying covariate, we used a multi-level model with random intercepts for each person. To partition the total effect, we employed within-person centering (equivalent to a fixed effects model) to distinguish the within- and between-person contribution separately. Thus the within-person estimates represent the strength of the 1-year lagged association between the weights and mental illness, after removing stable between-person differences in the level of the predictor and the outcome [@rohrer2021these; @ligthart2016comparison]. It is unaffected by unobserved time-invariant confounders (an important advantage), but it likewise cannot estimate the effect of time-invariant variables in the context of the model such as gender or other stable demographic features (these can be estimated by a different/separate model if of interest).  

```{r total_effects}
df <- modelframe %>%
  mutate(across(c(weighted, unweighted), ~c(scale(.))))

totalfitwgt <- glmer(ill_next_year ~ weighted + (1|xwaveid), 
                     data = df, family = binomial)
totalfitunw <- glmer(ill_next_year ~ unweighted + (1|xwaveid), 
                     data = df, family = binomial)
totalfitall <- glmer(ill_next_year ~ weighted + unweighted + (1|xwaveid),
                     data = df, family = binomial)
```

The estimated terms as odds ratios (`exponentiate=T`) are shown below:  
```{r print_total, echo=F}

  tidy(totalfitwgt, effects = "fixed", conf.int=T, exponentiate=T) %>%

**Mental illness predictions**  

The regression coefficients presented above were standardized to allow comparison of the effect size and precision. The weighted and unweighted estimates had similar total effects, either in separate models or when included in the same model and both predicted a higher likelihood of illness (*&beta;*OR > 1, *p*s < .05). After partitioning the total effect into within- and between-effects, the unweighted &beta; indicated life events were associated with a substantial increase in risk of illness when considering differences between people or across the population (*&beta;*OR = 2.02Â±.057), however a longitudinal change in life events (within a person) predicted a reduced likelihood of illness (*&beta;*OR = 0.94Â±.018) â€” opposite to that expected. By contrast, the weighted predicted an increased risk of illness both between- and within-people (within *&beta;*OR = 1.02Â±.02, *p* = .12, between *&beta;*OR = 1.61Â±.05). When the within-effect of the weighted and unweighted scores was estimated in the same model, the predictive value of the weighted scores was still positive, *&beta;*OR = 1.1Â±.027, *p* < .05.    

In both instances, the positive association between score and mental illness exists on the between-person level â€” people who on average have a higher score are at more risk of mental illness, however this association may be affected by time-invariant third variables (gender, age, ses, personality traits). The weighted score represents the most clinically-relevant effect, here indicating a positive change in a person's life event weighted score was associated with a future risk of mental illness.

## Discussion  

The use of generic weights rather than subjective weights is promoted on the grounds that generic weights are _a priori_ independent from the experience of the event, and so can predict consequences of the stress exposure such as the risk of poor health. Interestingly the rank-ordering of life events assigned by diverse subgroups are often highly correlated (*&rho;* > 0.9), suggesting a shared or generalizable experience of stress, which also supports the use of generic weights. Others have argued the generalizability of any life event scale will be limited to the population on which the weights were developed [@dohrenwend1974stressful; @zimmerman1983methodological]. The HILDA sample on which our weights were developed was selected to be representative of Australia, but we expect the weights would be equally applicable to other developed Western nations.

##### Limitations  

Events are broad and vaguely defined, and so may capture heterogeneity in the response (e.g., divorce, vs divorce after a period of marital conflict and infidelity) [@dohrenwend2006inventorying]

##### Strengths  

Problems in defining and sampling the relevant population for stressful life events are often present in life events research [see @dohrenwend1974stressful], but are minimised here by probabilistic sampling of the Australian population in HILDA. Furthermore, the relationship between a stressful life event and a health outcome can be interpreted as causal when exposure to the event occurred for reasons that are random with respect to the outcome [@kessler1997effects], which is the case here under HILDA's probabilistic sampling method. However selection bias may still exist if some victims are less likely to report an event than others (e.g., homelessness, sexual assault, or severely affected sufferers).
